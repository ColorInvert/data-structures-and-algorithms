# Singly Linked List
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Assemble in python, using a node and linked list class, a functional singly linked list, along with a suite of tests proving functionality and adherence to existing specifications.
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
No whiteboard was required for this assignment.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Approaches are adherent to the specifications defined by the assignment. Only BigO requirement listed was "Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance." for the insert() method.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
linked_list.py contains the solution code, and can be run via ```python linked_list.py``` for a small print example showing the insert and includes methods are working correctly.

Pytest can be run in the data_structures directory to prove the passing of all tests present in test_linked_list.py.
