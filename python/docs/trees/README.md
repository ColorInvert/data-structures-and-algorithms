# Trees
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Node

    Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Binary Tree

    Create a Binary Tree class
        Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
            pre order
            in order
            post order
        Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

Binary Search Tree

    Create a Binary Search Tree class
        This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
        Add
            Arguments: value
            Return: nothing
            Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
        Contains
            Argument: value
            Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Recursive function. Compare added value to root, and pick a path depending on if higher or lower. if something exists in one of those spaces already, recurse and do the same from the new location.
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
Code is in binary_search_tree.py, and can be confirmed of fucntion via the use of pytest.
